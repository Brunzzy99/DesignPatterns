= FACTORY PATTERN

A creational design pattern that is responsible for creating objects when it is called.
A factory is a class that creates objects of a prototype class, aka interface, from a method call.

=== USES OF FACTORY PATTERN:
* When a method returns one of several possible classes that share a common super class
* When you don't know ahead of time what class object you need
* When all the potential classes are in the same subclass hierarchy
* To centralize class selection code
* When you don't want the user to have to know every subclass
* To encapsulate object creation
