= PROTOTYPE PATTERN

A creational design pattern.
The Prototype pattern is generally used when we have an instance of the class (prototype), and we'd like to create new objects by just copying the prototype.

=== USES OF PROTOTYPE PATTERN:
* When there are numerous potential classes that you want to only use if needed at runtime
* Reduces the need for creating subclasses
