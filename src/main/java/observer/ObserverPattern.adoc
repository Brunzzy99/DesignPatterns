= OBSERVER PATTERN

Observer is a behavioral design pattern.
It specifies communication between objects: *observable* and *observers*.
An observable is an object which notifies observers about the changes in its state.

=== USES OF OBSERVER PATTERN:
* When you need many other objects to receive an update when another object changes
* Loose coupling (observable doesn't need to know anything about the observers)

=== NEGATIVE SIDES OF OBSERVER PATTERN
* Observer may send updates that don't matter to the observer
