= COMMAND PATTERN

The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern and is part of the Gang Of Four's formal list of design patterns.
Simply put, the pattern intends to encapsulate in an object all the data required for performing a given action (command),
including what method to call, the method's arguments, and the object to which the method belongs.

In a classic implementation, the command pattern requires implementing four components: the Command, the Receiver, the Invoker, and the Client.

=== USES OF COMMAND PATTERN:
* Allows us to decouple objects that produce the commands from their consumers
* Allows us to store lists of code that is executed at a later time or many times
* Allows us to implement undo procedures for past commands
