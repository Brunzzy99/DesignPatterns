= DECORATOR PATTERN

A Decorator provides an enhanced interface to the original object.
In the implementation of this pattern, we prefer composition over an inheritance â€“ so that we can reduce the overhead of subclassing again and again for each decorating element.
The recursion involved with this design can be used to decorate our object as many times as we require.

=== USES OF DECORATOR PATTERN:
* To attach additional responsibilities to an object either statically or dynamically.
* Allows you to modify an object dynamically.
* When you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses, but you need to add functionality at run time.
* Simplifies code because you add functionality using many simple classes.
* When you want to extend old code with new code.
