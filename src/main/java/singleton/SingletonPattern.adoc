= SINGLETON PATTERN

=== USES OF SINGLETON PATTERN:
* When you want to eliminate the option of instantiating more than one object.

=== NEGATIVE SIDES OF SINGLETON PATTERN
* We distinguish two types of issues with singletons:
    ** existential (Do we need a singleton?)
    ** Implementation (Do we implement it properly?)
